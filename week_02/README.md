# Week 2 Notes

*Develop a few novel questions (at least 4) that data can answer. Consider this a brainstorm of what you might address for your semester project.*

This questions are tied to my actual job. I work for a rental car company:

1. What is the top city in terms of rents?
2. Why kind of car category rent the most?
3. What are the factor that makes this category the most selected?
4. How many more vehicles can this city hold?

I forgot to mention, but this was revised by my supervisor who agrees to let me run this project. In his words "I will be a major breakthrough for the company having this level of analysis"
